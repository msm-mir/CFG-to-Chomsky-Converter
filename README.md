# 🖨️ CFG to CNF Converter

This project  converts a given **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** into **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**. The purpose of this transformation is to simplify the grammar and prepare it for parsing algorithms such as CYK. This program is implemented in **C++** as part of a Theory of Automata and Formal Language course and based on an object-oriented programming (OOP).

---

## 💡 Features

- Reads a context-free grammar from input.
- Input include: terminal symbols, non-terminal symbols, and production rules.
- Converts the CFG to CNF step by step using standard transformation rules.
- Outputs the resulting CNF grammar in the same format as the input.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- Implemented in C++
- The core concept of the project is the transformation of CFGs into **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**
